# setup
This folder includes settings for my personal dev setup.

## Terminal
Personally, since MacOS Catalina, I've made the switch from `bash` to `zsh`, built with [spaceship-prompt](https://github.com/denysdovhan/spaceship-prompt)

## Updates
Auto-updates for [brew](https://brew.sh/) are defined here using `launchctl`.
